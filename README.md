# PS's Snippets Collection üêà

This is my personal code-snippets collection. They are not like vscode snippets just normal chunks of code that I tend
to forget but use a lot, or just chunks of code that I don't want to rewrite. Use this at your own risk as they work on
my machine but may not on yours ( lol jk ).
